To implement this structure, you could use React Navigation for handling the different screens and state management (like Redux or Context API) to manage the app's state, including user progress and quiz data. The JavaScript object with the curriculum data could be stored in a separate file and imported where needed, making it easy to update the content without changing the app's core functionality.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this structure or suggest how to implement any particular feature?
